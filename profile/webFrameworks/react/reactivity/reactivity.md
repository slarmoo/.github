# Reactivity

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: `props`, `state`, and `render`.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's `state` or `prop` objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's `render` function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

The following example contains two components. A parent Survey component and a child Question component. The Survey has a state named `color`. The Question has a property named `color`. The Survey passes its `color` state to the Question as a property. This means that any change to the Survey's color will also be reflected in the Question's color. This is a powerful means for a parent to control a child's functionality.

The Question component also has a state named `answer`. The value of answer is displayed as part of the Question's content. The user can interact with this state through HTML radio input elements. When one of the inputs is changed the Question's `onChange` function is called and the answer state is updated to reflect the user's choice. This automatically causes the display of the answer to be updated.

Be careful about your assumptions of when state is updated. Just because you called `updateState` does not mean that you can access the updated state on the next line of code. The update happens asynchronously, and therefore you never really know when it is going to happen, you only know that it will eventually happen.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [color, updateColor] = React.useState('#737AB0');

  // When the color changes update the state
  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateColor(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the Question.
          When to color changes the Question property will also be updated and rendered. */}
      <Question color={color} />

      <p>
        <span>Pick a color: </span>
        {/* Pass the Survey color state as a property to the input element.
            When to color changes, the input property will also be updated and rendered. */}
        <input type='color' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} value={color} />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ color }) => {
  const [answer, updateAnswer] = React.useState('pending...');

  function onChange({ target }) {
    updateAnswer(target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <span>Do you like this</span>
      {/* Color rerendered whenever the property changes */}
      <span style={{ color: color }}> color</span>?
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='yes' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        Yes
      </label>
      <label>
        <input type='radio' name='answer' value='no' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} />
        No
      </label>
      {/* Answer rerendered whenever the state changes */}
      <p>Your answer: {answer}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<Survey />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## ☑ Assignment

Create a fork of this [codePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzYzXE) and experiment. Try changing the input from using the color and radio button, to using an edit box that reactively displays the text as you type.

When you are done submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository notes.md with all of the things you learned and want to remember.

### 🧧 Possible solution

If you get stuck here is a possible solution.

```jsx
// The Survey component
const Survey = () => {
  const [text, updateText] = React.useState('');

  const onChange = (e) => {
    updateText(e.target.value);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Survey</h1>
      <Question text={text} />

      <p>
        <span>Type some text: </span>
        <input type='text' onChange={(e) => onChange(e)} placeholder='type here' />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

// The Question component
const Question = ({ text }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You typed: {text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
