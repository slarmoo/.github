# Storage services

Web applications commonly need to store files associated with the application or the users of the application. This includes files such as images, user uploads, documents, and movies. Files usually have an ID, some metadata, and the bytes representing the file itself. These can be stored using a database service, but usually that is overkill and a simpler solution will be cheaper.

It might be tempting to store files directly on your server. This is usually a bad idea for several reasons.

1. Your server has limited drive space. If you server runs out of drive space your entire application will fail.
1. You should consider your server as being ephemeral, or temporary. It can be thrown away and replaced by a copy at any time. If you start storing files on the server, then your server has state that cannot be easily replaced.
1. You need backup copies of your application and user files. If you only have one copy of your files on your server, then they will disappears when your server disappears, and you must always assume that your server will disappear.

Instead you want to use a storage service that is specifically designed to support production storage and delivery of files.

## AWS S3

There are many such solutions out there, but one of the most popular ones is [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). S3 provides the following advantages:

1. It has unlimited capacity
1. You only pay for the storage that you use
1. It is optimized for global access
1. It keeps multiple redundant copies of every file
1. You can version the files
1. It is performant
1. It supports metadata tags
1. You can make your files publicly available directly from S3
1. You can keep your files private and only accessible to your application

In this course we will not be using an storage services for the Simon project. If however, you want to use S3 as the storage service for your Startup application then you need to learn how to use the AWS SDK. You can find detailed information about using AWS S3 with Node.js on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-started-nodejs.html). Generally, the steps you need to take include:

1. Creating a S3 bucket to store your data in.
1. Getting credentials so that your application can access the bucket.
1. [Using](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) the credentials in your application.
1. Using the [SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/s3-example-creating-buckets.html) to write, list, read, and delete files from the bucket.

⚠ Make sure that you do not include your credentials in your code. If you check your credentials into your GitHub repository they will immediately be stolen and used by hackers to take over your AWS account. This may result in significant monetary damage to you.
