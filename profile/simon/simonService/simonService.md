# Simon Service

![Simon](../simon.png)

This deliverable demonstrates converting the JavaScript application into a web application by implementing a web service that listens on a network port for HTTP requests. The web service provides endpoints for getting and updating the scores. The application also uses a couple third party endpoints to display inspirational quotes on the about page and show a random header image.

We will use Node.js and Express to create our HTTP service.

You can view this application running here: [Example Simon Service](https://simon-service.cs260.click)

## Service endpoint definitions

Here is our design, documented using `curl` commands, for the two endpoints that the Simon web service provides.

**GetScores** - Get the latest high scores.

```sh
curl -X GET /api/scores

#Response
{ "scores":[
  {"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"},
  {"name":"도윤 이", "score":"95", "date":"2019/05/20"}
]}
```

**SubmitScore** - Submit a score for consideration in the list of high scores.

```sh
curl -X POST /api/score -d '{"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"}'

#Response
{ "scores":[
  {"name":"Harvey", "score":"337", "date":"2022/11/20"},
  {"name":"도윤 이", "score":"95", "date":"2019/05/20"}
]}
```

## Third party endpoints

The `about.js` file contains code for making calls to third party endpoints using `fetch`. We make one call to `picsum.photos` to get a random picture and another to `quotable.io` to get a random quote. Once the endpoint asynchronously returns, the DOM is updated with the requested data. Here is an example of the quote endpoint call.

```js
function displayQuote(data) {
  fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      const containerEl = document.querySelector('#quote');

      const quoteEl = document.createElement('p');
      quoteEl.classList.add('quote');
      const authorEl = document.createElement('p');
      authorEl.classList.add('author');

      quoteEl.textContent = data.content;
      authorEl.textContent = data.author;

      containerEl.appendChild(quoteEl);
      containerEl.appendChild(authorEl);
    });
}
```

## Steps to convert Simon to a service

Converting Simon to a service involved the following steps.

1. Move all the previous deliverable code files (_.html, _.js, \*.css, favicon.ico, and assets) into a sub-directory named `public`. We will use the HTTP Node.js based service to host the frontend application files. This is done with the static file middleware that we will add our service `index.js`.

   ```js
   app.use(express.static('public'));
   ```

   When running our service the static file middleware takes care of reading the frontend code from the `public` directory and returning it to the browser. The service only directly handles the endpoint requests.

1. Within the project directory run `npm init -y`. This configures the directory to work with **node.js**.
1. Modify or create `.gitignore` to ignore `node_modules`.
1. Install the Express package by running `npm install express`. This will write the Express package dependency in the `package.json` file and install all the Express code to the `node_modules` directory.
1. Create a file named `index.js` in the root of the project. This is the entry point that **node.js** will call when you run your web service.
1. Add the basic Express JavaScript code needed to host the application static content and the desired endpoints.

   ```js
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // The service port. In production the frontend code is statically hosted by the service on the same port.
   const port = process.argv.length > 2 ? process.argv[2] : 3000;

   // JSON body parsing using built-in middleware
   app.use(express.json());

   // Serve up the frontend static content hosting
   app.use(express.static('public'));

   // Router for service endpoints
   const apiRouter = express.Router();
   app.use(`/api`, apiRouter);

   // GetScores
   apiRouter.get('/scores', (_req, res) => {
     res.send(scores);
   });

   // SubmitScore
   apiRouter.post('/score', (req, res) => {
     scores = updateScores(req.body, scores);
     res.send(scores);
   });

   // Return the application's default page if the path is unknown
   app.use((_req, res) => {
     res.sendFile('index.html', { root: 'public' });
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

1. Modify the Simon application code to make service endpoint requests to our newly created HTTP service code.

   ```js
   async function loadScores() {
     const response = await fetch("/api/scores")
     const scores = await response.json()

     // Modify the DOM to display the scores
   ```

### Configuring Vite for debugging

When running in production, the Simon web service running under Node.js on port 3000 serves up the Simon React application code when the browser requests `index.html`. This is the same as we did with previous Simon deliverables. The service pulls those files from the application's static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files located in the `public` directory that we set up when we build the production distribution package.

![Setting up React ports](simonProduction.jpg)

However, when the application is running in debug mode in your development environment, we actually need two HTTP servers running: one for the Node.js backend HTTP server, and one for the Vite frontend HTTP server. This allows us to develop and debug both our backend and our frontend while viewing the results in the browser.

By default, Vite uses port 5173 when running in development mode. Vite starts up the debugging HTTP server when we run `npm run dev`. That means the browser is going to send network requests to port 5173. We can configure the Vite HTTP server to proxy service HTTP and WebSocket requests to the Node.js HTTP server by providing a configuration file named `vite.config.js` with the following contents.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:3000',
      '/ws': {
        target: 'ws://localhost:3000',
        ws: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When running in this configuration, the network requests now flow as shown below. Without this you will not be able to debug your React application in your development environment.

![Setting up React ports](simonDevelopmentDebugging.jpg)

With our server running, and our files in the place where Vite expects them, we can test that everything still works. You can start Vite in dev mode with the command `npm run dev`, followed by pressing the `o` key to open the application in the browser. When you reach this point with your startup, make sure that you commit your changes.

## Study this code

Get familiar with what the example code teaches.

- Clone the repository to your development environment.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service.git
  ```

- Review the code and get comfortable with everything it represents.
- Debug the code in your browser by hosting it from a VS Code debug session. This [video on debugging a node.js based service](https://youtu.be/B0le_Z_2TQY) will step you through the process.

  ⚠ You will no longer use the `live server` extension to launch your frontend code in the browser since your frontend code will now be served up by the Node.js server you created in `index.js`. Set breakpoints in your backend code inside of VS Code.

- Use the browser's dev tools to set breakpoints in the frontend code and step through it each line.
- Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.

## Deploy to production

- Deploy to your production environment using a copy of the `deployService.sh` script found in the [example class application](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-service/blob/main/deployService.sh). Take some time to understand how it works.

  ```sh
  ./deployService.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon
  ```

  For example,

  ```sh
  ./deployService.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
  ```

  ⚠ **NOTE** - The deployment script for this project is different from previous deployment scripts, since it needs to set up the Node.js service for your backend code, and copy your frontend code to the `public` directory. You also want to make sure that your Node.js HTTP service code for Simon is configured to listen on port 3000. When you deploy your Startup you want to make sure that code is configured to listen on port 4000.

- Update your `startup` repository `notes.md` with what you learned.
- Make sure your project is visible from your production environment (e.g. https://simon.yourdomain.click).
